📘 Project Overview:
This project analyses how car features influence pricing and profitability across different market segments. By leveraging Excel-based analytics, the goal is to help manufacturers align product development and pricing strategies with market demand and customer preferences. The project reveals key drivers behind price variation, consumer interest, and brand positioning.

📊 Objectives:
* Understand which car features most significantly affect MSRP.
* Identify trends across fuel types, engine specs, and manufacturers.
* Evaluate how consumer preferences align with product supply.
* Support data-driven decision-making for pricing and product strategy.

🛠 Tech Stack:
* Microsoft Excel 2019 – Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Regression, Visualization
* Microsoft PowerPoint 2019 – Presentation of key insights
* Google Drive – File sharing and backup

📈 Approach:
1. Data Collection & Cleaning

* Imported the dataset into Excel

* Handled missing/null values using median/mode imputation

* Standardised values for uniform analysis

2. Exploratory Analysis

* Used pivot tables, slicers, and charts to explore relationships

* Visualised key metrics like price, MPG, and horsepower

3. Statistical Analysis

* Applied regression to find price influencers

* Correlation and trendline analysis for feature interactions

🧮 Dataset Summary
* Rows Analysed: 11,200 (from 11,915 original)

* Columns: 16

* Key Sheet: Dataset_Cleaned

* Missing Values: Treated using median (numeric) and mode (categorical)

🔍 Key Insights: 
1. Market Category & Popularity
* Diesel & Flex Fuel: Few models but high popularity → fuel efficiency favoured
* Luxury: Oversupply with low popularity → pricing mismatch
* Factory Tuner: Low volume, high demand → niche value

2. Engine Power & Price
* Strong positive correlation between engine horsepower and MSRP
* Trendline and R² value indicate that performance significantly drives price

3. Feature Importance (via Regression)
* Most influential: Engine HP, Cylinder Count
* Less impactful: MPG (inverse relation), Popularity

4. Manufacturer Price Variation
* Top tier: Bugatti, Rolls-Royce, Lamborghini (Exclusivity and performance)
* Mainstream: Toyota, Honda – affordability and reliability
* Disruptors: Tesla – high average MSRP due to EV tech

5. Fuel Efficiency & Engine Cylinders
* Moderate negative correlation: More cylinders = lower MPG
* Regression: y = -2.98x + 43.51 (R² = 0.36)

📊 Dashboard Highlights:
1. Price Distribution by Brand & Body Style
* Convertibles & Crew Cab Pickups are the most expensive
* Hatchbacks and cargo vans are the most economical

2. Transmission Impact
* AUTOMATED_MANUAL commands premium in performance cars
* MANUAL is the least costly, now limited to base trims or niche markets

3. MPG Trends (1990–2017)
* Regulatory standards (CAFE) increased MPG fleet-wide
* Hybrids and EVs reshaped efficiency norms, especially for sedans & hatchbacks

4. Brand-Level Comparison
* Tesla leads MPG due to EVs
* Bugatti & Lamborghini top horsepower and price charts
* Plymouth & Suzuki are lowest in cost and performance

✅ Conclusion:
* Performance sells: HP and cylinder count are key price drivers
* Efficiency ≠ Expense: Fuel-efficient cars often fall in mid-to-low price tiers
* Brand and segment matter: Exotic brands sell prestige, mass-market brands deliver value
* Strategic takeaway: Focus on high-demand fuel-efficient models, re-align strategy in oversupplied categories
